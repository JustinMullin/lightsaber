lightsaber
=====

Built for a Nerdery JVM Challenge over about 4 hours.  Fueled by excitement for new Star Wars next month.  Written in Scala and [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) with the help of [Drifter](https://github.com/JustinMullin/drifter), a little convenience library I use for [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/) competitions and jams.

This project shows off libGDX, OpenGL ES 2.0 shaders, and the effect a few sound effects and animations can do for interactive polish.  I don't claim this code to be of any particular quality.  It was written to get things done fast, and isn't documented or whatever.  Sorry!

```./gradlew run``` to run locally.
